# StockScreener App

The App consists of a stock screener and a charting app. The stock screener finds unique trading opportunities among a universe of thousands of stocks. The user has the ability to filter stocks based on user-specified criteria, sort and rank them based on stock data or indicator calculations. The charting app allows to display highly customizable charts. The user can specify the stock symbol, bar period, indicators, time periods and chart sizes.

The app uses React on the frontend, NodeJS and ExpressJS on the backend with PostgreSQL as a database.

The repo has been separated into a repo dedicated to the frontend (https://github.com/pnoebauer/stock-screener-frontend) and a repo dedicated to the backend (https://github.com/pnoebauer/stock-screener-backend-mongoDB) with MongoDB as the database.
